## 📖 About This Project

This is a task tracking application that lets you:
- Add new tasks with descriptions
- Edit existing tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks you don't need
- View history of all completed tasks
- Clear all completed tasks at once

The app has a nice, modern design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. It's built to be simple to use but still powerful enough to help you stay organized.

## 🛠️ What I Used to Build This

- **React** - For building the user interface
- **Vite** - For fast development and building
- **CSS** - For styling and making it look good
- **Netlify** - For hosting the website online

That's it! I kept it simple and focused on making a good user experience.
